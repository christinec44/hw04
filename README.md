Calculation of area of a triangle given three different points. Inside the triangle is a circle of radius r. r = (2*A)/p, where A is the area of the triangle and p is the triangle's perimeter. The perimeter of the triangle is found based upon the function distance. The vertices for this are a = (2.,2.), b = (-2., 1.), c = (0., -3.).
